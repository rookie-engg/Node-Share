# Node Share

Node share is a project trying to make bi directional file sharing over a LAN network possible with the help of NodeJS. Its main aim is to able to trasfer a file or folder to a mobile from a PC. wihout use of internet data.

We all have been furstrated at some point where new laptops have lesser and lesser usb ports which are already occupied by exteral keyboards or mouse. Node Share allows to trasfer files without using slower Usb or bluetooth.

Today most of users connect to internet by making use of mobile hotspot which is connected to there computer or laptop so if they want to compya file/folder to mobile from pc they have to use a USB cable or bluetooth. Which is very slow and sometimes the usb cable is not available.

There a already solutions for the same problem like android apps like `zapya, etc` but these do not offer to send **multile** files and whole **folder** at same time but Node-Share allows to transfer single file, **muliple**,**folder** to mobile device or infact to any other device on the network which can run a browser.

You can download the NodeShare setup from github releases section
