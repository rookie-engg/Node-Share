# Node Share

Node Share is a project trying to make bi-directional file sharing over a LAN network possible with the help of NodeJS. Its main aim is to be able to transfer a file or folder from a PC to a mobile device without using internet data.

We have all been frustrated at some point when new laptops have fewer USB ports, which are already occupied by external keyboards or mice. Node Share allows you to transfer files without relying on slower USB or Bluetooth connections.

Today, most users connect to the internet by using mobile hotspots that are connected to their computers or laptops. If they want to copy a file or folder from their PC to their mobile device, they often have to use a USB cable or Bluetooth, which can be slow and sometimes unavailable.

While there are already solutions for the same problem, like Android apps such as `zapya, etc`, they do not offer the ability to send **multiple files** and entire **folders** at the same time. However, Node Share allows you to transfer single files, **multiple files**, and **folders** to a mobile device or any other device on the network that can run a browser.

## Download

You can download the Node Share setup from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/rookie-engg/Node-Share/releases) section.

## Prerequisites

Before using Node Share, please keep the following in mind:

1. Make sure the sender PC and receiver PC or mobile device are on the same network, such as by connecting the PC to the mobile hotspot.

2. Allow Node Share to access the public and private network in the network settings.

## Steps to Transfer from PC to Mobile

To transfer files from a PC to a mobile device using Node Share, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the PC and the mobile device are on the same network, e.g., by turning on the mobile hotspot and connecting the PC to it.

2. Run the Node Share executable.

3. Scan the QR code on the screen using your mobile device or manually type the provided URL in a mobile browser like Chrome. Make sure you type the URL in the address bar, not in a search engine.
